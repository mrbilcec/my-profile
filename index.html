				<p>*My<strong> second profesional experience</strong> I had was between 2016-2018 and it was my first job in Switzerland, as a bartender in a bowling center, a job that helped me save money to finance my MBA studies. Did you know that actor <strong>John Krasinski</strong> was a bartender before auditioning for the role of Jim Halpert in "The Office?"</p>
				<p>*Starting <strong>March 2020</strong> I started an internship at <a href="https://www.gavi.org/">GAVI</a> doing business analysis in the Finance & Operations department reporting directly to the Managing Director.
